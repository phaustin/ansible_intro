### CO_2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii and the South Pole

This plot shows measurements of monthly-averaged CO_2 concentrations (in parts per million or ppm) at two locations  between 1958 and 2021, plus an adjustable straight line. See "Credits" below for data sources.

### Instructions for exploring data
- Select data sets with **Data Source** checkboxes.
- Use the **Select Month** dropdown box to choose any month or a combination of months. Small "x"s deselect any chosen options.
- Set **x-axis or y-axis** end points by dragging open circles at both ends of the axis-sliders. These changes persist when changing data or line choices.
- **Graph axes** can also be changed by dragging axis end points or panned by dragging the middle of the axis (not persistent when changing data or line choices).
- Click a **legend** item to hide or reveal the data (not persistent when changing data or line choices). Double click a legend item to isolate the corresponding data. 
- **Icons** above right over the graph have mouse-over tool tips. Double-click anywhere on the graph toggles between the "Autoscale" and "Reset Axis" states. 
- **Zoom** works by using click-drag in the graph.

### Instructions for manually fitting a straight line
- Display a straight line by checking the **adjustable straight line** check box.
- Use **slope** and **intercept** sliders to adjust the straight line. **Hint:** Click the slider at its current value, then use left/right keyboard arrow keys to move the value. 
- Adjust the line to match any chosen portion of the data as closely as possible. **Hint:** Do this roughly first, with full scale graph axes. Then use axis sliders to zoom in before fine tuning the straight line to fit your chosen portion of the data. 
- Set a **Prediction Year** and "predicted" CO_2 is given, based simply on your straight line.
